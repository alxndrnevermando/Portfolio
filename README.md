## Features

I included some pretty cool documentation from Bootstrap, such a nifty and easy tool to use (when I'm not overthinking it and ruining the styling). In the navigation bar I used the same navbar that I had used in a previous class activity. My background image was something that I wanted to give the page a more personal touch. I do not care for boring backgrounds, and whenver possible I try to use a cool background.

In the layout of my body's pages, I included some simple grids that I could find. I didn't want to overcomplicate things, and I used the provided homework images in this assignments instructions as a template. What I am looking to get working is my contact page, as this is for me a fun part, but perhaps that requires some back-end knowledge.

## Installation
Pretty simple to deploy this, simply cut and paste the url into you preferred browser. No need to download.
