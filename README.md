## homework-2

Whew! This was truly an exercise in patience. I have a little experience in designing a simple portfolio/bio website, but that did not make it any easier. I think I over complicated the Bootstrap grid layout in my about and contact, since I would go throught a similar chain of tasks before landing on what I wanted: copy bootstrap content into file --> add some CSS to make it look slightly nicer --> realize this messed up my flow --> troubleshoot for hours --> realize that what I needed to do was minimeze the CSS styling so as to not override the inherent styling of the bootstrap content. Overall, I am probably still not 100% not satisfied with how it ended, but I think I accomplished the goal of this assignment.

## Motivation

This is barely weekj 3, so I can't give up yet!!

## Features

I included some pretty cool documentation from Bootstrap, such a nifty and easy tool to use (when I'm not overthinking it and ruining the styling). In the navigation bar I used the same navbar that I had used in a previous class activity. My background image was something that I wanted to give the page a more personal touch. I do not care for boring backgrounds, and whenver possible I try to use a cool background.

In the layout of my body's pages, I included some simple grids that I could find. I didn't want to overcomplicate things, and I used the provided homework images in this assignments instructions as a template. What I am looking to get working is my contact page, as this is for me a fun part, but perhaps that requires some back-end knowledge.
